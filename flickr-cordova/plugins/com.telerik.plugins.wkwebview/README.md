## 1. Description

_BETA_ - things may break, [please post your feedback :)](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-wkwebview/issues)

* Allows you to use the new WKWebView on iOS 8 (the simulator is supported as well).
* Falls back to UIWebView on iOS 7 and lower.
* Will hopefully cease to exist soon (when Apple releases a fixed WKWebView so Cordova can use it without the hacks I needed to apply).
* As a matter of fact, [Apache is working on a similar plugin (which you can't use at the moment of writing)](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/tree/master/wkwebview-engine) which I came across after releasing version 0.1.1. It targets Cordova 3.7.0 and up whereas this plugin is supported on 3.0.0 an up. 

### TIPS

* [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) tip: to prevent flashes of a black background, make sure you set `ion-nav-view`'s `background-color` to `transparent`.
* If you need the [device plugin](org.apache.cordova.device), use at least Cordova-iOS 3.6.3 (deviceready never fires with 3.5.0 due to a currently unknown reason).
* When making AJAX requests to a remote server make sure it supports CORS. See the [Telerik Verified Marketplace documentation](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/wkwebview) for more details on this and other valuable pointers.

## 2. Screenshot
This image shows the [SocialSharing plugin](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin) in action while running [a performance test](https://www.scirra.com/demos/c2/particles/) in an iframe on my iPhone 6 (older devices show an even larger difference).
It's a screenshot of the [demo app](demo/index.html).

## 3. Installation

```
$ cordova plugin add com.telerik.plugins.wkwebview
$ cordova prepare
```

No need for anything else - you can now open the project in XCode 6 if you like.

## 4. Changelog

* __0.3.0__  Enhanced loading files with the embedded HTTP server, thanks #36!
* __0.2.7__  Cut app startup time in half - not noticable unless you have a lot of files in your app, see #32
* __0.2.6__  `Config.xml` settings like `MediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction` (autoplay HTML 5 video) are now supported, see #25.
* __0.2.5__  Fixed a script error for Cordova 3.5.0 and lower, see #17.
* __0.2.4__  Compatibility with the `device` plugin on Cordova 3.5.0 and lower, see #17.
* __0.2.3__  Compatibility with the `close` function of the [Ionic Keyboard Plugin](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard).
* __0.2.2__  Compatibility with plugins which use the superview of the 'classic' webview, like [ActivityIndicator](https://github.com/Initsogar/cordova-activityindicator)
* __0.2.1__  LocalStorage sync between UIWebView and WKWebView - on a real device as well
* __0.2.0__  LocalStorage sync between UIWebView and WKWebView - on a simulator only
* __0.1.3__  Compatibility with [InAppBrowser](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser)
* __0.1.2__  Compatibility with plugins like [Toast](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Toast-PhoneGap-Plugin) which add a subview to the webview (they didn't show)
* __0.1.1__  Cleanup to get rid of a few (deprecation) warnings - lots left (on purpose) because they're thrown by a 3rd party framework and can be safely ignored
* __0.1.0__  Added support for loading local files via XHR. This should now transparently work for $.ajax, AngularJS templateUrl's, etc. To this end the plugin adds an embedded HTTP server on port 12344 which is stopped when the app is put to sleep or exits.
* __0.0.1__  Initial version

## 5. Credits
This plugin was inspired by the hard work of the Apache Cordova team [(and most notably Shazron)](https://github.com/shazron/WKWebViewFIleUrlTest).
